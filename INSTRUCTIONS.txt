Hello!

To run this file, there is an executable file inside of the Debug folder. The application is called "ConsoleApplication3". If you run this file, the program will run. 
In addition to this, I have created a shortcut to that executable file in the folder where this INSTRUCTION.txt file is found. It is called "Bank Application" and will also run the program.
